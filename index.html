        <h2>What is a vulnerability?</h2>
        <p>Before we delve into the explanation of cross site scripting, let’s take a look at 
            vulnerabilities and what they actually are. <br><br>
            A vulnerability is a weakness that attackers can use to exploit and gain unauthorised 
            entry into a computer system. Picture a house with high security locks on all doors and 
            windows, all the windows and doors are locked shut, except the front door; this essentially 
            allows anyone access into the property whether they are welcome or not. They can roam around 
            the house, take whatever they want and change whatever they want, this concept is similar to 
            a vulnerability and a computer system. <br><br>
            Often times computer systems are extremely secure, but there is always a vulnerability or two hidden 
            that allows attackers entry into the system, whether they are welcome or not, again, these attackers 
            can take whatever they want and change whatever they want. <br><br>
            A few vulnerabilities to name are cross site scripting, injection, ransomware, broken access control 
            and so many more. <br><br></p>
            <h2>Cross Site Scripting</h2>
            <p>Now let’s take a look at cross site scripting, what exactly is it? <br><br>
                Cross site scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability, whereby malicious client-side scripts are 
                injected into trusted websites and are then executed by an unsuspecting end user. <br><br>
                The reason as to why XSS attacks can be initiated or executed is because the end browser has no method 
                in place to detect malicious or untrusted scripts. This means once an attacker injects malicious scripts 
                into a trusted website, it will execute them scripts assuming they are from a trusted source. Once this 
                attack is in place the malicious scripts can be used to access cookies, session tokens, sensitive data, 
                redirect users to malicious websites, and so much more. <br><br>
                There are many types of cross site scripting attacks a few to name are: <br><br>
                •	DOM based <br><br>
                •	Stored <br><br>
                •	Blind <br><br>
                To know more about these vulnerabilities, take a look around this website. </p>
